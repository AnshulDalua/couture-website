          <p className="text-xs mb-6">Your sisterhood deserves better than generic bulk tees that end up in the back of closets. Custom sorority hoodies have become the gold standard for chapter merchandise—something sisters actually want to wear, not just tolerate. Whether you're planning for bid day, philanthropy events, or creating a permanent chapter staple, this guide covers everything you need to know about ordering sorority hoodies your chapter will be proud to wear.</p>

          <h2 className="text-xs uppercase font-medium mt-12 mb-4">WHY HOODIES WORK FOR SORORITIES</h2>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6">Let's be real: everyone has too many t-shirts. They pile up, get stained, and eventually get donated. But a quality hoodie? That's something sisters keep. Hoodies transition from recruitment events to lazy Sundays to campus walks in October. When done right, your chapter hoodie becomes a piece of clothing, not just a promotional item.</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6">The rise of "sweatset" culture has only amplified this. Matching hoodies with your big or your pledge class? It's giving coordinated, it's aesthetic, and it makes for incredible Instagram moments. Chapters that invest in quality merch create stronger visual identities—and that translates to stronger chapter pride.</p>

          <h2 className="text-xs uppercase font-medium mt-12 mb-4">FABRIC QUALITY: WHAT SEPARATES GOOD FROM GREAT</h2>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6">Not all hoodies are created equal, and the difference is felt immediately. Here's the breakdown:</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6"><strong>280 GSM and below:</strong> Lightweight, good for warmer climates or summer events. Won't hold up as primary chapter wear.</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6"><strong>320 GSM:</strong> The middle ground. Decent weight, reasonable warmth. Most "custom hoodies" fall in this range.</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6"><strong>400-420 GSM:</strong> Heavyweight fleece. This is where premium happens. Think American Apparel or Champion reverse weave quality—or better. These hoodies feel substantial, hold shape through washes, and actually keep you warm.</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6">For sorority chapters, we recommend the 400+ GSM range. Yes, it costs more—but when sisters are competing with other chapters for bid day, when philanthropies are showcasing your organization, you want hoodies that look and feel expensive. Cheap merch reflects poorly on your chapter. Premium merch says you care about your brand.</p>

          <h2 className="text-xs uppercase font-medium mt-12 mb-4">DESIGN ELEMENTS THAT WORK</h2>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6">Sorority hoodie design requires balance. You want to showcase your letters and chapter identity without looking cluttered. Here's what works:</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6"><strong>Front placement:</strong> Your letters are your brand. Keep them clean and legible. Small chest placement (left side) works best for everyday wear. Full front works for statement pieces.</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6"><strong>Back design:</strong> This is where you can get creative. Chapter crest, philanthropy theme, year established, or a fun slogan that captures your chapter's personality. Keep it readable from a distance—you want people to know who you are at events.</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6"><strong>Sleeve details:</strong> Year, paddle date, chapter founding date, or a small symbol. Sleeve prints add polish without overwhelming.</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6"><strong>Color choices:</strong> Dark hoodies with light ink photograph better and hide wear. But if your chapter has lighter brand colors, don't force dark—just expect members to be more careful with staining.</p>

          <h2 className="text-xs uppercase font-medium mt-12 mb-4">PRINTING VS. EMBROIDERY</h2>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6"><strong>Screen printing</strong> remains the standard for bulk orders. Vibrant colors, durable results, cost-effective at scale. The tradeoff is setup fees per color, so simpler designs with 1-2 colors get the best value.</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6"><strong>Embroidery</strong> adds that elevated, premium feel. Stitched letters look sophisticated and last forever. It's perfect for small chest logos or sleeve details. The limitation is detail—intricate designs don't translate well to thread.</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6"><strong>Hybrid approach:</strong> Many chapters do embroidered letters on the chest with screen-printed back designs. Best of both worlds.</p>

          <h2 className="text-xs uppercase font-medium mt-12 mb-4">QUANTITIES AND TIMING</h2>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6">Minimums vary by vendor. Some demand 100+ units, which works for large chapters but hurts smaller ones or specific events. Couture by Ikigai works with orders as low as 12 units—perfect for:</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6">- Big/Little reveal pairs
          <br />- Executive board gifts
          <br />- Philanthropy committee merch
          <br />- Testing designs before full chapter orders</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6">Timeline: Plan for 2-3 weeks once designs are finalized. For bid day, lock designs in 4-6 weeks. Rush orders are available but premium pricing applies.</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6">Pro tip: Order 10-15% extra. Sizes run out, new members join, alumnae want to purchase. Having extras prevents awkward shortages.</p>

          <h2 className="text-xs uppercase font-medium mt-12 mb-4">PRICING REALITY CHECK</h2>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6">Quality has a price. Here's what to expect:</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6"><strong>Budget tier ($15-25):</strong> Lightweight, basic printing, will degrade quickly. Not worth it for chapter merch.</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6"><strong>Mid-tier ($30-45):</strong> Decent weight, good printing. The category most vendors push.</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6"><strong>Premium ($45-65):</strong> Heavyweight fleece, quality printing, excellent construction. This is where your chapter stands out.</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6">The math works: if a $25 hoodie gets worn 5 times before being discarded, that's $5 per wear. A $55 hoodie worn 50 times? That's over $1 per wear—and it still looks good. Quality merch is actually the smarter spend.</p>

          <h2 className="text-xs uppercase font-medium mt-12 mb-4">MAKING IT HAPPEN</h2>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6">Ready to order? Here's your action plan:</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6">1. <strong>Define purpose:</strong> Bid day? Philanthropy merch? Chapter-wide staple?
          <br />2. <strong>Gather assets:</strong> Letters (vector format), chapter crest, colors
          <br />3. <strong>Set budget:</strong> Per-unit cost + design fees + shipping
          <br />4. <strong>Choose vendor:</strong> Look for Greek life experience, sample quality, design support
          <br />5. <strong>Review proofs:</strong> Colors, placement, sizing
          <br />6. <strong>Order samples:</strong> Always get a sample before full production</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6">Your sisterhood deserves hoodies you'll actually wear. Don't settle for "good enough."</p>

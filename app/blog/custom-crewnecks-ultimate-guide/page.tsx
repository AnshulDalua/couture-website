          <p className="text-xs mb-6">Custom crewnecks are the backbone of any serious merch collection. While t-shirts come and go with the seasons, a premium embroidered crewneck is a year-round staple that people actually wear. Whether you're outfitting a startup team, a Greek life chapter, a student organization, or a music crew, crewnecks deliver that perfect blend of everyday wearability and premium feel that makes your group look cohesive and professional.</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6">If you're in the market for custom crewnecks, this guide covers everything you need to know—from fabric weights and decoration methods to pricing, sizing, and design best practices that actually result in merch people want to wear.</p>

          <h2 className="text-xs uppercase font-medium mt-12 mb-4">Why Custom Crewnecks Work</h2>
          <p className="text-xs mb-6">Here's the thing about crewnecks: they hit that sweet spot between casual and premium. Unlike t-shirts, which can feel like walking billboards, or hoodies, which can feel too casual for some settings, a well-made crewneck is versatile enough to wear to the office, out with friends, or to class. It signals belonging without trying too hard.</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6">For organizations, crewnecks offer several practical advantages. They're excellent for team building—there's something special about matching outfits that creates instant unity. They're also more gender-neutral than many other merch options, making them easier to order in bulk without worrying about size distributions. And unlike trendier items that might feel dated next year, crewnecks have timeless appeal.</p>

          <h2 className="text-xs uppercase font-medium mt-12 mb-4">Fabric Weights: Finding the Right Balance</h2>
          <p className="text-xs mb-6">The fabric weight you choose will make or break your crewneck order. Get it too light and it'll feel cheap; too heavy and you'll have expensive, boxy garments that nobody wants to wear in your climate.</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6"><strong>Lightweight (8-10 oz):</strong> Great for year-round wear in warmer climates or as a layering piece. These are more affordable and work well for large orders, but they might feel less premium to some customers.</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6"><strong>Midweight (10-12 oz):</strong> The sweet spot for most organizations. These have enough substance to feel quality without being too heavy. Perfect for spring, fall, and mild winters.</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6"><strong>Heavyweight (12+ oz):</strong> Premium feel, excellent durability, but best suited for colder climates or winter wear. These are the warmest options but can feel bulky.</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6">Our recommendation: go midweight for versatility. Most organizations find that 10-12 oz cotton-blend fleece gives the best balance of comfort, durability, and perceived value.</p>

          <h2 className="text-xs uppercase font-medium mt-12 mb-4">Embroidery vs. Printing: Making the Right Call</h2>
          <p className="text-xs mb-6">This is where many organizations make mistakes. The decoration method you choose will dramatically impact both the look and longevity of your crewnecks.</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6"><strong>Embroidery:</strong> The premium choice for crewnecks. Embroidery adds texture, dimension, and a tactile quality that screen printing simply can't match. Embroidered designs have a perceived value 2-3x higher than printed equivalents. The thread sits on top of the fabric rather than soaking in, creating that distinctive 3D effect. Embroidery also lasts essentially forever—no cracking, fading, or peeling even after hundreds of washes.</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6">The trade-off: embroidery works best with simpler designs. Very detailed photos, gradients, or complex illustrations don't translate well to thread. For most organization logos and text-based designs, embroidery is the clear winner.</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6"><strong>Screen Printing:</strong> Better for full-coverage designs, photorealistic images, or designs with many colors. Screen printing inks actually bond with the fabric fibers, allowing for vibrant, full-color reproduction. However, print on fleece can feel stiff or crack over time, especially with frequent washing.</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6"><strong>Direct-to-Garment (DTG):</strong> Best for complex, colorful designs in smaller quantities. DTG allows for unlimited colors and detail without setup costs, making it economical for small orders. The trade-off is that DTG prints can feel less premium on the thick fleece fabric.</p>

          <h2 className="text-xs uppercase font-medium mt-12 mb-4">Design Best Practices</h2>
          <p className="text-xs mb-6">Even the highest quality crewneck will look cheap if the design is off. Here's what works:</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6"><strong>Placement matters:</strong> The most common placement is left chest for a subtle look (2-3 inches from the collar, centered) or center chest for more visibility. For back designs, consider the area across the shoulders. </p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6"><strong>Size appropriately:</strong> A design that looks great on a t-shirt will look massive on a crewneck. Scale down your logo by about 30-40% when moving to fleece.</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6"><strong>Consider the fleece texture:</strong> Embroidered designs pop best on smooth, tightly woven fleece. Looser, softer fleece can make embroidery look puffy or uneven.</p>

          <h2 className="text-xs uppercase font-medium mt-12 mb-4">How to Price Your Crewneck Order</h2>
          <p className="text-xs mb-6">Understanding the economics of custom crewnecks helps you set realistic budgets and avoid surprises.</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6">Key pricing factors include:</p>
          <ul className="text-xs mb-6 list-disc pl-6">
            <li className="mb-2"><strong>Quantity:</strong> Like most custom products, crewnecks have significant economies of scale. Going from 24 to 100 units can cut per-unit costs by 30-40%.</li>
            <li className="mb-2"><strong>Decoration method:</strong> Embroidery costs more than printing but delivers better perceived value.</li>
            <li className="mb-2"><strong>Fabric quality:</strong> Premium cotton fleece costs more than synthetic blends.</li>
            <li className="mb-2"><strong>Color options:</strong> Each colorway typically requires a separate setup fee for embroidery.</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6">Most organizations find that custom embroidered crewnecks in quantities of 24+ range from $35-60 per unit, depending on design complexity and fabric quality. For larger orders (100+), pricing typically drops to $25-40 per unit.</p>

          <h2 className="text-xs uppercase font-medium mt-12 mb-4">Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
          <p className="text-xs mb-6">After helping hundreds of organizations with crewneck orders, we've seen these mistakes repeatedly:</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6"><strong>Going too cheap on fabric:</strong> That $15 crewneck from a budget supplier will feel like it costs $15. Your group will notice, and nobody will want to wear them.</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6"><strong>Overcomplicating the design:</strong> Remember: embroidery isn't print. Complex designs with many small details will get lost or look muddy when stitched.</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6"><strong>Ignoring sizing:</strong> Always order samples in your target sizes. What a size medium looks like varies dramatically between brands.</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6"><strong>Waiting too long:</strong> Custom crewnecks typically take 2-4 weeks for production, plus shipping. Don't plan a reveal event for next week if you just placed the order.</p>

          <h2 className="text-xs uppercase font-medium mt-12 mb-4">Ready to Order?</h2>
          <p className="text-xs mb-6">Custom crewnecks are an investment in your organization's identity. Take the time to get the design, fabric, and decoration method right, and you'll have merch that people actually wear—and that makes your group look professional and cohesive.</p>

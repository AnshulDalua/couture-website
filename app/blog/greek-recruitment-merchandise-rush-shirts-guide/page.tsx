            Recruitment season is approaching, and your chapter needs custom merchandise that actually gets worn. Not hung in a closet or worse—thrown away. Here's how to order Greek recruitment apparel that your members will treasure long after Bid Day.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Every year, fraternities and sororities across the country order rush shirts and recruitment merchandise. And every year, most of it ends up in the donation bin by October. The difference between merch that gets worn and merch that gets wasted comes down to three things: quality, design, and timing.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">Why Quality Matters for Recruitment Merchandise</h2>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            Here's the uncomfortable truth most Greek merchandise vendors don't want to talk about: cheap rush shirts reflect poorly on your chapter. When prospective members receive a thin, poorly printed t-shirt during recruitment week, it sends a message. It says your chapter cuts corners.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            On the flip side, premium recruitment apparel makes a statement. When your new members receive a soft, well-fitted hoodie or a durable tee with crisp printing, they feel valued. They're proud to wear it. And in Greek life, where first impressions matter enormously, that matters.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">Choosing the Right Apparel for Each Recruitment Event</h2>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Different recruitment events call for different merchandise. Here's how to think about it:
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3">Open House & Tours</h3>
          <p className="mb-6">
            Lightweight t-shirts work best for open house events where rushees are walking around campus. Look for ringspun cotton (30/1 or 24/1 gauge) for a softer feel. Avoid heavy cotton—it's too warm for indoor events and washes poorly over time.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3">Bid Day</h3>
          <p className="mb-6">
            Bid Day is your chance to make a splash. This is where premium hoodies shine. A 280-320 GSM heavyweight hoodie with your chapter letters creates that "welcome to the family" moment. Embroidered letters on hoodies look more prestigious than printed designs, and they last through four years of college wear.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3">Recruitment Week Events</h3>
          <p className="mb-6">
            ForMixers, philanthropy events, and socials during recruitment week, consider matching tank tops for warmer days or quarter-zip pullovers for evening events. Versatility is key—you want merch that works across different settings.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">Design Elements That Actually Work</h2>

          <p className="mb-6">
            The best Greek recruitment designs share certain characteristics. They balance chapter identity with aesthetic appeal, they're recognizable from a distance, and they avoid the trap of cramming too much information onto one garment.
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Chapter letters prominently displayed</strong> — Prospective members should instantly know which chapter you represent</li>
            <li><strong>Limited text</strong> — A short slogan or recruitment theme works better than paragraphs</li>
            <li><strong>Class-appropriate design</strong> — What resonates with 18-year-olds differs from what works for seniors</li>
            <li><strong>Year or class year</strong> — Adds collectibility and creates a sense of belonging to a specific cohort</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">Common Mistakes Chapters Make</h2>

          <p className="mb-6">
            After working with hundreds of Greek organizations, we've seen the same errors repeat every recruitment season:
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>1. Ordering too late.</strong> The best vendors book out 3-4 weeks during peak recruitment season. Last-minute orders mean settling for lower quality or paying rush fees.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>2. Prioritizing price over quality.</strong> That $5 rush tee seems like a good budget choice—until you're handing out flimsy apparel that makes your chapter look cheap.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>3. Ignoring sizing.</strong> Greek recruitment merch needs to fit diverse body types. Order a size range that actually matches your chapter's demographics, not just the standard distribution.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>4. Generic designs.</strong> Your chapter is unique. Generic "Greek Week" shirts don't create the same emotional connection as designs that reflect your specific chapter culture.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">Timing Your Order: A Practical Timeline</h2>

          <p className="mb-6">
            For Fall 2026 recruitment, here's when to start the process:
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>8 weeks before recruitment:</strong> Start gathering design ideas and确定 chapter preferences</li>
            <li><strong>6 weeks before:</strong> Finalize your design and submit to your vendor</li>
            <li><strong>4 weeks before:</strong> Confirm sizing quantities and place your order</li>
            <li><strong>2 weeks before:</strong> Merchandise arrives—distribute to active members</li>
            <li><strong>1 week before:</strong> Prepare recruitment packages for new members</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">What Sets Premium Recruitment Merchandise Apart</h2>

          <p className="mb-6">
            When evaluating vendors for your Greek recruitment merchandise, look for these quality indicators:
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Fabric weight specifications</strong> — Quality vendors list GSM (grams per square meter) for their garments</li>
            <li><strong>Print durability guarantees</strong> — Screened prints should last 50+ washes without cracking</li>
            <li><strong>Design assistance</strong> — The best vendors help you create a design that actually looks good</li>
            <li><strong>Bulk pricing transparency</strong> — You should know exactly what you're paying per unit</li>
            <li><strong>Licensing compliance</strong> — Your vendor should understand national Greek organization branding guidelines</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">Making Your Investment Count</h2>

          <p className="mb-6">

          <p className="text-xs mb-6">If you're a chapter officer tasked with ordering merch, you've probably heard it a hundred times: "can we get matching hoodies and pants?" That's a sweatset—a matching hoodie and sweatpants combo that's become the gold standard for Greek life apparel. But actually ordering them? That's where it gets complicated.</p>

          <h2 className="text-xs uppercase font-medium mt-12 mb-4">Why Sweatsets Are the Move</h2>
          <p className="text-xs mb-6">Here's the thing about单个 hoodies: they're cool, but they don't make a statement the way a full matching set does. When your whole chapter shows up to Bid Day in identical sweatsets, it's a vibe. It's visual unity. It's the kind of content that gets posted, saved, and remembered.</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6">Beyond aesthetics, sweatsets are practical. The hoodie handles the cold—game days, late-night walks across campus, chapter events in drafty venues. The sweatpants are what people actually wear to hang out in. Having both means your merch gets worn more, not just photographed and forgotten in a drawer.</p>

          <h2 className="text-xs uppercase font-medium mt-12 mb-4">What to Look for in Quality Sweatsets</h2>
          <p className="text-xs mb-6">Not all custom merch is created equal, and this is especially true for sweatsets. You're going to be wearing these together, so both pieces need to match in color, fabric weight, and overall feel. Here's what actually matters:</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6"><strong>Fabric weight:</strong> Most places use lightweight 8-10 oz blanks. That's fine for a t-shirt, but for a sweatset you want something heavier—think 12 oz or more. Heavier fabric holds its shape, feels premium, and actually lasts more than one semester. We use 420 GSM heavyweight fabric for ours, which is the same weight you'd find at Supreme or Fear of God.</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6"><strong>Consistency:</strong> This is where a lot of custom merch companies fail. The hoodie and sweatpants need to be made from the same blank, using the same dye process, so the colors match exactly. Nothing looks worse than a "matching" set where the hoodie is slightly darker than the pants.</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6"><strong>Construction:</strong> Look for reinforced seams, quality stitching around the pockets, and cuffs that actually stay up. These are details that don't show up in product photos but matter when you're wearing the piece for the hundredth time.</p>

          <h2 className="text-xs uppercase font-medium mt-12 mb-4">Design Options That Actually Work</h2>
          <p className="text-xs mb-6">For Greek life, the design usually breaks down into a few categories. The most popular is chapter letters—big, bold, across the chest or on the back. That's a classic for a reason. But there's room to get more creative:</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6"><strong>Chapter crest or crest-inspired design:</strong> This works well if your chapter has a recognizable symbol. It feels more official without being stuffy.</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6"><strong>Chapter nickname or slogan:</strong> Many chapters have inside jokes or nicknames that translate well to merch. "Chapter Name: Where the Wild Things Are" type stuff.</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6"><strong>Year or class year:</strong> Super popular for graduation classes or for marking a specific year. "Class of 2027" on the sleeve is simple but meaningful.</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6"><strong>Chapter mascot or symbol:</strong> Subtle references to your chapter's mascot or symbol can work if done right. The key is keeping it minimal—embroidered on the chest or printed small on the pocket.</p>

          <h2 className="text-xs uppercase font-medium mt-12 mb-4">Ordering: How Many Do You Need?</h2>
          <p className="text-xs mb-6">This is the question we get most often, and honestly, it depends. Here's a rough breakdown:</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6"><strong>Minimum order:</strong> Most suppliers have minimums, sometimes 20-30 pieces per style. At Couture, we don't force you into a huge order—you can do as few as 12 of each piece (hoodie + sweatpants = 12 sets), which is perfect for smaller chapters or testing a design.</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6"><strong>Rush week:</strong> For a typical sorority rush, you're looking at 50-150 pieces. Enough for every new member to get one, with extras for actives who want to match.</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6"><strong>Full chapter order:</strong> For a complete chapter reorder, 100-200 sets is common. Some chapters order every year; others only once every few years.</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6"><strong>Budget tip:</strong> If you're price-sensitive, go with screen printing instead of embroidery. It looks just as good, lasts forever, and typically costs less per piece.</p>

          <h2 className="text-xs uppercase font-medium mt-12 mb-4">Timeline: When to Start Planning</h2>
          <p className="text-xs mb-6">Here's a reality check: good custom merch takes time. If you want sweatsets for Bid Day in August, you should be starting the conversation in April or May at the latest. Here's why:</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6"><strong>Design phase:</strong> Expect 1-2 weeks to finalize your design. This includes brainstorming, mockups, revisions, and final approval. The more specific you are about what you want, the faster this goes.</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6"><strong>Production:</strong> Once the design is approved, production takes 2-3 weeks. This varies by vendor—some take longer during peak seasons (which, for Greek life, is basically always September).</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6"><strong>Shipping:</strong> Add another week for shipping, especially if you're ordering during a busy period.</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6">So: if you need them for fall, start in spring. If you need them for spring, start in late fall. Trust us—the stress of rushing is not worth saving a few weeks.</p>

          <h2 className="text-xs uppercase font-medium mt-12 mb-4">The Design Support Question</h2>
          <p className="text-xs mb-6">This is where vendors really differ. Some give you a blank template and send you on your way. Others offer full design help—and for Greek life chapters, that's usually the better option.</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6">Here's why: most chapter officers aren't professional designers. You might know exactly what you want the merch to look like, but translating that into print-ready files is a whole different skill. A good vendor will have a designer who can take your ideas and make them look professional, suggest improvements, and make sure the final product actually looks good.</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6">At Couture, this is what we do. We've worked with 150+ University of Michigan chapters alone, so we know what works—bold letters, clean layouts, colors that match your chapter's palette. We'll walk you through the whole process and won't call it done until you're excited about the design.</p>

          <h2 className="text-xs uppercase font-medium mt-12 mb-4">Making Your Sweatsets Actually Get Worn</h2>
          <p className="text-xs mb-6">Here's the brutal truth: a lot of Greek life merch ends up unworn. It gets ordered, distributed, photographed, and then forgotten. People keep them in closets or donate them. That's a waste of chapter money and honestly, it's kind of sad.</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6">The difference between merch that gets worn and merch that doesn't comes down to two things: quality and design. If the fabric feels cheap, people won't reach for it. If the design is boring or generic, people won't want to be seen in it.</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6">This is why we push heavyweight fabric and thoughtful design. A 420 GSM hoodie that feels substantial, with a design that's actually cool—not just your letters slapped on—becomes something people wear on repeat. It becomes part of the chapter's identity, not just a obligation.</p>

          <h2 className="text-xs uppercase font-medium mt-12 mb-4">Ready to Get Started?</h2>
          <p className="text-xs mb-6">If you're thinking about ordering sweatsets for your chapter, we'd love to help. We've done this hundreds of times, we know what designs work, and we won't waste your time with a confusing ordering process.</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6">Here's how it works: reach out, tell us about your chapter and what you're envisioning, and we'll get you a design mockup within a few days. No pressure, no commitment. Just see what we'd do and decide if you like it.</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6">Your chapter deserves merch that's actually worth wearing. Let's make it happen.</p>

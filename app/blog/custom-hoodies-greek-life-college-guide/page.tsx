          <p className="text-xs mb-6">Every fraternity and sorority reaches that moment—your chapter needs matching hoodies. Maybe it's for bid day, maybe it's for philanthropy, maybe you just want something that actually represents your chapter well. But walking into the custom apparel world feels overwhelming. There are a dozen vendors, a fabric options, and prices hundred that range from "why is this so cheap" to "why does this cost more than my tuition."</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6">This guide breaks down everything you need to know about ordering custom hoodies that your chapter will actually wear—not just tolerate until rush cleanup.</p>

          <h2 className="text-xs uppercase font-medium mt-12 mb-4">FABRIC WEIGHT MATTERS MORE THAN YOU THINK</h2>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6">The number one mistake chapters make? Going too light. Everyone sees "hoodie" and thinks lightweight cotton-poly blend. But for Greek life and college orgs, you want something that feels substantial. That 420 GSM heavyweight fleece from Couture exists for a reason—it actually feels premium, holds up through wash cycles, and doesn't shrink into a crop top after one run through the dryer.</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6">Here's the breakdown: anything under 280 GSM is basically a light jacket. It'll work for Florida chapters or spring events, but for a hoodie your guys will wear to tailgate in October? Too thin. The 320-420 GSM range is the sweet spot—hefty enough to feel like quality, not so heavy that it's unbearable to wear walking to class. Most importantly, that heavier fleece holds its shape. Your hoodie looks just as good in April as it did in November.</p>

          <h2 className="text-xs uppercase font-medium mt-12 mb-4">PRINTING METHODS: WHAT LASTS VS. WHAT FADES</h2>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6">Not all printing is created equal, and the difference between quality work and something that cracks after three washes comes down to technique. Let's walk through the main options.</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6"><strong>Screen printing</strong> is the industry standard for bulk orders. It layers ink directly onto the fabric, creating that crisp, vibrant look you're used to seeing. The tradeoff is setup costs—every color in your design requires its own screen. That's why most vendors push you toward simpler designs with fewer colors. But for large orders (think full chapter hoodies), the per-unit cost drops significantly.</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6"><strong>Direct-to-garment (DTG)</strong> is basically a high-quality printer that sprays ink directly onto the fabric. It's perfect for complex, multi-color designs without setup fees. The downside? It doesn't quite match the durability of screen printing, and the ink sits on top of the fabric rather than soaking in. Fine for a one-semester event hoodie, less ideal for something you want lasting.</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6"><strong>Embroidery</strong> gives that classic, elevated look—think letters stitched onto a polo or your chapter crest on a quarter-zip. It adds texture and depth that printing can't match. The limitation is detail: intricate logos don't translate well to thread, and pricing scales with stitch count. Embroidery works best for smaller placements (chest logo) rather than full-front designs.</p>

          <h2 className="text-xs uppercase font-medium mt-12 mb-4">DESIGN TIPS THAT ACTUALLY WORK</h2>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6">Here's where most chapters fumble. You have your letters, your chapter crest, maybe a Greek god or some经典 mythology reference. But putting all of that on a hoodie requires strategy—not just dumping everything on the chest.</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6">For Greek life, the most effective approach is simplicity. Your letters are your brand. Everything else should support, not compete. A clean letter treatment on the front, maybe a small crest or year on the sleeve, and a larger back design for events creates a cohesive look. The best chapter hoodies we've seen at Couture treat the hoodie like a uniform, not a canvas for everything you've ever designed.</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6">Color choice matters more than people realize. Dark hoodies with light ink pop more than the reverse—they photograph better at events, hide wear and tear longer, and look more premium. But if your chapter has brand colors that are lighter, don't force dark. Just expect to need slightly more careful care.</p>

          <h2 className="text-xs uppercase font-medium mt-12 mb-4">ORDERING: QUANTITIES AND TIMING</h2>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6">The minimum order question comes up constantly. Some vendors demand 50, 100, even 200 units before they'll print. That's fine for large chapters but brutal for smaller ones or one-time events. Couture works with orders as low as 12 units—which opens up possibilities for smaller committees, event-specific merch, or just testing designs before committing to full chapter orders.</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6">Timing-wise, plan for two to three weeks once you finalize your design. Rush orders exist but cost significantly more. For bid day hoodies, get designs locked at least a month ahead. For philanthropy events, six weeks gives you breathing room. Custom apparel isn't instant—good things take time, and the rush job is where quality slips.</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6">One pro tip: always order 10-15% extra. People lose weight, gain weight, want to buy extras for alumni or sweetest friends. Having a few spares prevents awkward "we don't have your size" conversations.</p>

          <h2 className="text-xs uppercase font-medium mt-12 mb-4">PRICING: WHAT YOU SHOULD EXPECT</h2>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6">Here's the uncomfortable truth: cheap hoodies are cheap for a reason. A $15 hoodie from a bulk vendor is going to feel like a $15 hoodie—thin fabric, basic printing, questionable construction. You're not saving money if your chapter refuses to wear them.</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6">For quality heavyweight hoodies with proper printing, expect to invest $35-55 per unit depending on quantity, design complexity, and printing method. That sounds steep compared to the $20 option, but here's the math: if your chapter actually wears the hoodie for two years instead of abandoning it after one semester, you've come out ahead. Plus, quality merch reflects on your chapter. Everyone notices the difference.</p>

          <h2 className="text-xs uppercase font-medium mt-12 mb-4">MAKING IT HAPPEN</h2>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6">The ordering process doesn't have to be painful. Start with your chapter's brand guidelines—colors, fonts, existing logos. Identify the purpose: event merch, recruitment wear, alumni gifts, casual chapter hoodies. Figure out your quantity and budget. Then find a vendor who actually understands Greek life.</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6">The right partner handles design, production, and delivery with minimal friction. Look for vendors who offer real design support, not just a template uploader. Ask about fabric sourcing and print quality. Request samples if you're unsure. Your chapter deserves hoodies you'll actually want to wear.</p>

          <p className="text-xs mb-6">Custom hoodies for your chapter is one of those things that seems simple but has a lot of nuance. Get it right, and you've got merchandise your chapter wears with pride. Get it wrong, and you've got a pile of regretted purchases in someone's closet. This guide gives you the foundation to get it right.</p>
